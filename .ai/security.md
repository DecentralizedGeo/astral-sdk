## Security Considerations  
Building this SDK involves both **smart contract security** (via EAS) and **application security**. We have woven many security best practices into the design already; this section highlights and adds to them:

- **EAS and Attestation Security**: EAS is an audited system for attestations; using it on-chain inherits blockchain security (immutability, etc.). The SDK must use EAS correctly:
  - Use the correct schema UID to prevent schema confusion attacks (we hardcode or fetch it from a trusted source ([Data Model | Astral Documentation](https://docs.astral.global/docs/data-model#:~:text=uint256%20eventTimestamp%2Cstring%20srs%2Cstring%20locationType%2Cstring%20location%2Cstring,mediaData%2Cstring%20memo))).
  - Ensure when creating an attestation that the data respects expected types (e.g., `srs` should likely always be "WGS84" for now – the SDK will default to that ([Data Model | Astral Documentation](https://docs.astral.global/docs/data-model#:~:text=%22event_timestamp%22%3A%20%222023,image%2Fjpeg))).
  - If marking an attestation as revocable or not, be conscious of trade-offs: revocable proofs can be later nullified by the prover (which Astral's API shows as `revoked: true` if done) ([Data Model | Astral Documentation](https://docs.astral.global/docs/data-model#:~:text=,been%20revoked%20by%20the%20prover)). Non-revocable proofs are permanent but that could be dangerous if data is wrong. Possibly default to revocable = true for user safety, unless specified otherwise. We should expose this as an option in ProofOptions.
  - Off-chain signatures need secure random nonce if EAS uses any (though EAS UID itself is a hash, so uniqueness is inherent). We rely on EAS's standard for computing UID to avoid collisions.

- **Geospatial Data Integrity**: The SDK should validate geospatial data formats to avoid malicious input:
  - If someone passes a GeoJSON that's extremely large (e.g., a polygon with thousands of points), this could blow up the on-chain transaction. We can set a sane limit (maybe number of coordinates or string length) and warn or error if exceeded. This is important for preventing unexpectedly high gas usage or denial-of-service if someone tries to misuse it.
  - If supporting user-provided media, be cautious of memory – do not hold a huge base64 string in memory unnecessarily or loop inefficiently. We will stream to IPFS if needed rather than reading entire file into string if possible (though likely, small images might be okay).
  - Use well-known libraries or standards for any cryptography (like using ethers for signing/verification ensures we follow EIP-712 correctly).
  
- **Possible Vulnerabilities & Mitigations**:
  - *Replay Attacks:* If an off-chain attestation is shared, someone could try to claim it as theirs. However, the attestation's content includes the `prover` (the attester's address) and a signature from that address. So a different user cannot claim it without also having that private key. On-chain, replay is not possible because the attestation is recorded to a specific address. To strengthen this, whenever verifying an off-chain proof, we ensure the signer (from signature) matches the expected prover and possibly check the `uid` wasn't already recorded on-chain by someone else (if relevant).
  - *Man-in-the-middle:* If our SDK communicates with the Astral API, we use HTTPS – ensure verification of SSL (default node https does). We might also provide an option to specify expected Astral API domain or fingerprint if needed for higher security contexts.
  - *Supply Chain & Dependencies:* We use well-known dependencies (EAS SDK, ethers, etc.) and will pin versions via package-lock. We will incorporate automated security audits (e.g., GitHub Dependabot alerts or `npm audit` in CI) to catch vulnerable packages ([SDK Best Practices - Speakeasy](https://www.speakeasy.com/post/sdk-best-practices#:~:text=SDK%20Best%20Practices%20,user%20error%20during%20user%20integration)).
  - *API Key Security:* If the Astral API requires a key, the SDK should allow it to be provided in a secure way (not hardcoded). In Node, via env var passed in. In browser, developers might use an API proxy or a restricted key. We will document not to expose secret keys in client code publicly.
  - *Data Privacy:* Location data is sensitive. Our SDK is not responsible for user consent, but we should encourage best practices in docs (like informing users that posting location on-chain is public). If needed, we could later incorporate an option to **encrypt** location data before attesting (then only share decryption key with authorized parties). That could be a future enhancement (and an extension type "encrypted").
  
- **Testing for Security:** We will write tests specifically to ensure security measures hold:
  - Attempt to create an attestation with invalid data and expect a ValidationError.
  - Ensure that verifying a tampered off-chain attestation (e.g., change a field but not signature) fails verification.
  - Possibly integrate static analysis (like `npm run lint` with security rules or use TypeScript ESLint's recommendations to avoid dangerous patterns). For example, no use of `eval` or new Function, etc., in our code (shouldn't be needed at all).
  
- **Leverage EAS and ethers Best Practices:** EAS and ethers are known for their robust approaches:
  - The EAS SDK already uses ethers.js internally, providing secure transaction signing and nonce management.
  - We'll leverage this existing integration rather than implementing any custom signing code.
  - EAS SDK handles the correct domain separation in signatures through ethers.js.
  - Ethers helps protect against some common pitfalls (like it throws if a transaction will fail due to gas estimation).
  
- **Hardware Wallets and Providers:** The SDK design allows an external Signer – meaning it can work with hardware wallets or MetaMask, which add user confirmation steps. We encourage that integration in usage; nothing we do should preclude it (i.e., don't require the private key to be passed directly; accepting a Signer object is enough).
  
In summary, our SDK's security approach is to **trust the underlying audited components (EAS, ethers)** and add a layer of validation and caution around our specific domain (geospatial data and API calls). By doing so, we minimize introduction of new vulnerabilities and ensure that using the SDK doesn't inadvertently compromise either the blockchain or application security.
