## **5. AstralSDK Implementation Overview** 
 
*Description*: This document provides a high-level overview of the AstralSDK implementation. The detailed implementation is broken down into separate plans (5.1 Onchain Integration, 6 API Client, 7 API Integration, and 8 SDK Finalization) for better focus and clarity.
 
### Core Components and Responsibilities

The AstralSDK serves as the main entry point for the library, providing a unified interface for both offchain and onchain workflows while maintaining their separation. It delegates specialized functionality to these core components:

1. **OffchainSigner**: Handles cryptographic signing and verification for the offchain workflow
2. **OnchainRegistrar**: Manages blockchain interactions for the onchain workflow
3. **AstralApiClient**: Communicates with Astral's REST API for querying and publishing proofs
4. **ExtensionRegistry**: Manages the extension system for location formats, media types, and more

### API Structure

The SDK's public API follows this structure, with clear separation between workflows:

#### Initialization
- **Constructor**: `new AstralSDK(config?: AstralSDKConfig)`

#### Core Workflow Methods
- **Offchain Workflow**:
  - `signOffchainLocationProof(unsignedProof, options?): Promise<OffchainLocationProof>`
  - `createOffchainLocationProof(input, options?): Promise<OffchainLocationProof>`
  - `verifyOffchainLocationProof(proof, options?): Promise<VerificationResult>`
  - `publishOffchainLocationProof(proof, options?): Promise<OffchainLocationProof>`

- **Onchain Workflow**:
  - `createOnchainLocationProof(input, options?): Promise<OnchainLocationProof>`
  - `verifyOnchainLocationProof(proof, options?): Promise<VerificationResult>`
  - `revokeOnchainLocationProof(proof, options?): Promise<void>`

#### Query Methods
- `getLocationProof(uid): Promise<LocationProof>`
- `getLocationProofs(query): Promise<LocationProofCollection>`

#### Utility Methods
- `buildLocationProof(input): Promise<UnsignedLocationProof>`
- `createAndPublishOffchainProof(input, options?): Promise<OffchainLocationProof>`
- `getVersion(): string`
- `disconnect(): void`

#### Type Guards
- `isOffchainLocationProof(proof): proof is OffchainLocationProof`
- `isOnchainLocationProof(proof): proof is OnchainLocationProof`

### Implementation Sequence

We're implementing the AstralSDK in this order:

1. **Onchain Workflow Integration** (Plan 5.1): Complete the integration with OnchainRegistrar
2. **API Client Implementation** (Plan 6): Build the AstralApiClient for API communication
3. **API Client Integration** (Plan 7): Integrate the API client with the SDK
4. **SDK Finalization** (Plan 8): Complete any remaining methods and comprehensive testing

### Technical Requirements

- Clear separation between offchain and onchain workflows
- Proper delegation to specialized components
- Consistent error handling across all methods
- Comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- Support for both Node.js and browser environments
- Lazy initialization patterns for heavy components
- Debug logging for troubleshooting
- Thread safety for concurrent operations
- Clean and intuitive API surface
