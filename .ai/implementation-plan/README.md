## Implementation Plan (Task Breakdown)  
We break the development into **atomic, independent tasks**. Each task is described with its objective, inputs/outputs, and any technical notes. The tasks are ordered logically (though some can be done in parallel by different developers since modules are decoupled). This breakdown ensures that contributors can pick up tasks and implement them with minimal cross-coordination.

For every task, we want:
- You to review the task and make sure you have a clear understanding and a plan for execution
- You systematically work through the task and provide updates on your progress
- You to provide a detailed report on the task's completion, including any decisions made and the rationale behind them
- You run all linting, testing, and formatting checks to ensure the code is of high quality (this should be automated with a pre-commit hook)
- You write a delightfully detailed commit message for the task, and commit the changes to the repository
- You update the README.md file to reflect the task's completion, and add the commit hash to the task
