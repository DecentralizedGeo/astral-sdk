# Astral SDK Implementation Plan

This directory contains the detailed implementation plans for the Astral SDK project. 

## Current Implementation Phase

We are currently implementing **Phase 5: Astral SDK**, with a focus on completing the core SDK functionality including both offchain and onchain workflows.

## Implementation Order

The implementation plan is now structured in the following order:

1. **Setup & Infrastructure**: Initial project setup and configuration *(completed)*
2. **Types & Interfaces**: Core type definitions for the SDK *(completed)*
3. **Extension System**: The extensible architecture for location formats, media types, etc. *(completed)*
4. **EAS Client Integration**: Integration with Ethereum Attestation Service SDK *(completed)*
5. **AstralSDK Implementation**: 
   - **5.0**: SDK Overview - High-level overview of the complete SDK implementation
   - **5.1**: Onchain Integration - Complete the onchain workflow for location proofs
6. **Astral API Client**: Implementation of API client for proof retrieval and querying
7. **API Client Integration**: Integration of API client with SDK for complete functionality
8. **SDK Finalization**: Final integration, testing, and documentation

## Plan Files

### Active Implementation Plans

- `5.0-astral-sdk-overview.md`: High-level overview of the complete AstralSDK implementation
- `5.1-onchain-registrar-integration.md`: Integration of OnchainRegistrar with AstralSDK (current priority)
- `6-astral-api-client.md`: Implementation of the API client module (next priority)
- `7-astral-api-client-integration.md`: Integration of API client with AstralSDK
- `8-sdk-finalization.md`: Finalization of SDK implementation with testing and documentation

### Reference/Previous Plans

- `1-setup.md`: Project setup and configuration
- `2-types-interfaces.md`: Core type definitions
- `3-extension-system-code-review.md`: Review of extension system implementation
- `3-extension-system.md`: Extension system implementation
- `4-eas-client.md`: EAS client integration

### Future Roadmap

These files contain plans for future development phases and have been moved out of the main implementation sequence:

- `future-ipfs-multichain.md`: Future IPFS and multi-chain support
- `future-docs-examples.md`: Comprehensive documentation and examples
- `future-final-qa.md`: Final quality assurance and testing
- `future-orchestration-setup.md`: Deployment orchestration

## Implementation Strategy

Our current implementation strategy follows this ordered approach:

1. First, complete the onchain workflow by implementing the OnchainRegistrar integration (5.1)
2. Next, implement the AstralApiClient for proof retrieval and querying (6)
3. Then, integrate the API client with AstralSDK to complete the SDK functionality (7)
4. Finally, conduct comprehensive testing and finalize the SDK (8)

Each implementation plan is broken down into atomic tasks with checkboxes, detailed requirements, and completion validation steps.

## Alignment with API Documentation

All implementation plans are fully aligned with the API documentation (`.ai/api.md`), ensuring consistent method signatures, parameter types, and return values. The implementation maintains the clear separation between offchain and onchain workflows as described in the API documentation.
