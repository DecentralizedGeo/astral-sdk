## **9. Final Review & QA**  
   - [ ] *Description*: Before release, thoroughly review the codebase for consistency, performance, and completeness.  
   - *Sub-tasks*:
     - [ ] Conduct a full code review (maybe by a lead or pair programming if a team). Ensure naming is consistent, no leftover TODOs or debug logs, all public APIs are documented.
     - [ ] Run the test suite with coverage, ensure all critical paths are tested. Add tests if some branch is missing (aim for 90%+ coverage).
     - [ ] Test the built package manually: simulate a user by creating a separate project, installing this package (maybe via `npm pack` locally), and writing a small script using it. This is integration testing from a consumer perspective.
     - [ ] Profile or inspect bundle size: use `npx bundle-phobia` or similar to see how large the package is. Ensure it's within reason (maybe target < 1MB minified gzipped including deps, which is likely given EAS+ethers).
     - [ ] Check tree-shaking: as a test, import only the query function in a dummy project and see if the build includes EAS code or not (if using rollup + marking external, should not).
     - [ ] Verify that multi-chain addresses are correct by maybe actually creating an attestation on each (if possible) or at least using EAS scan to see if schema exists on them.
     - [ ] Bump version to 1.0.0 (if ready for initial release) or 0.1.0 as appropriate.
     - [ ] Tag release candidate and have CI run all steps. 
     - [ ] If all good, publish to npm and announce (if appropriate).
   - [ ] *Output*: A polished, production-ready SDK package on npm, with passing CI, high test coverage, and documentation published.
   - *Technical considerations*: 
     - [ ] Ensure licensing in code files if needed (MIT header? Usually not needed, just the LICENSE file).
     - [ ] The review should also double-check compliance with any standards (OGC, EAS usage).
     - [ ] Possibly have an external experienced TS developer glance at the API (if available) to see if anything is non-intuitive.
