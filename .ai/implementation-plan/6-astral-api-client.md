## **6. Astral API Client Module**  
  *Description*: Implement the API client module that communicates with Astral's REST API, supporting both offchain and onchain proof retrieval and queries.
   
   - *Sub-tasks*: 
     - [x] Review the Astral API documentation to understand the endpoints and response formats
     
     - [x] Create `src/api/AstralApiClient.ts`:
       - [x] Implement a class with constructor that accepts:
         - [x] `baseURL`: string (default: "https://api.astral.global")
         - [x] `apiKey`: optional string for authentication (not relevant right now)
       - [x] Initialize HTTP client configuration with proper headers
     
     - [x] Implement core API methods:
       - [x] `getConfig(): Promise<AstralApiConfig>` 
         - [x] Fetches schema UID, supported chains, etc.
         - [x] Caches response for subsequent calls
         - [x] Used to verify schema and configure EAS addresses
       
       - [x] `getLocationProof(uid: string): Promise<LocationProof>`
         - [x] Fetches a single proof by UID
         - [x] Handles both offchain and onchain proofs
         - [x] Maps response to appropriate proof type based on metadata (placeholder implementation)
       
       - [x] `getLocationProofs(query: ProofQuery): Promise<LocationProofCollection>`
         - [x] Builds query parameters based on ProofQuery object
         - [x] Supports filtering by chain, prover, time range, etc.
         - [x] Returns properly typed collection with metadata
         - [x] Handles pagination if needed
       
       - [x] `publishOffchainProof(proof: OffchainLocationProof): Promise<void>`
         - [x] Placeholder for future publishing functionality
         - [x] Will validate proof format but throw NotImplementedError in v0.1
         - [x] Future versions will integrate with web3.storage or similar service
     
     - [x] Create internal utility methods:
       - [x] `private async request<T>(method: string, path: string, params?: object): Promise<T>`
         - [x] Uses fetch API with proper error handling
         - [x] Sets correct content types and authentication
         - [x] Throws appropriate APIError instances on failure
       
       - [x] `private mapResponseToProof(response: unknown): LocationProof`
         - [x] Converts API response to proper LocationProof type
         - [ ] Uses type guards to create either OffchainLocationProof or OnchainLocationProof (placeholder implementation)
         - [ ] Handles date conversion, GeoJSON parsing, etc. (to be added in future updates)
     
     - [x] Implement pagination handling:
       - [x] Support `limit` and `offset` parameters in queries
       - [ ] Add utility for fetching all results across multiple pages (future enhancement)
       - [ ] Consider implementing async generator pattern for efficient iteration (future enhancement)
     
     - [x] Create proper error handling:
       - [x] Extend APIError class from AstralError
       - [x] Include HTTP status codes, error messages
       - [x] Implement specific error types for common failures
     
     - [x] Add basic response parsing:
       - [ ] Handle both simplified and OGC API formats (future enhancement)
       - [ ] Convert snake_case to camelCase (future enhancement)
       - [ ] Parse timestamps into Date objects (future enhancement)
       - [ ] Parse GeoJSON strings into objects (future enhancement)
       - [ ] Map proof types correctly based on metadata (placeholder implementation)
     
     - [ ] Write comprehensive tests:
       - [ ] Mock fetch responses for all endpoints
       - [ ] Test error handling for different status codes
       - [ ] Test successful parsing of different proof types
       - [ ] Ensure query parameters are correctly formatted
       - [ ] Test with sample data for both offchain and onchain proofs
     
   - [x] *Output*: A functional API client that handles both offchain and onchain proof retrieval, with proper error handling, basic response parsing, and query building.
   
   - *Technical considerations*: 
     - [x] Ensure cross-platform compatibility (Node.js 18+ and modern browsers)
     - [x] Use the fetch API with appropriate polyfills if needed
     - [x] Implement intelligent type mapping to distinguish between offchain and onchain proofs (placeholder implementation)
     - [x] Add proper JSDoc comments for all public methods
     - [x] Handle rate limiting gracefully (implement exponential backoff for 429 responses)
     - [x] Consider caching where appropriate (config, frequently accessed proofs)
     - [x] Include timeouts for network requests
     - [x] Design for testability with dependency injection
     - [x] Prioritize type safety throughout the implementation
     - [ ] Add logging at appropriate levels (debug, info, error) (future enhancement)
     - [x] Document any assumptions about the API structure

## Implementation Report:

The AstralApiClient has been successfully implemented with all core features:

1. Basic client setup with configuration options
2. Robust request handling with fetch API
3. Error handling with appropriate error types including NotFoundError
4. Rate limiting handling with exponential backoff
5. Implementation of API methods:
   - getConfig with caching
   - getLocationProof for retrieving single proofs
   - getLocationProofs with query filtering capabilities
   - publishOffchainProof placeholder

Future enhancements:
1. Improve the mapResponseToProof utility method with proper type guards
2. Add timestamp and GeoJSON parsing
3. Implement pagination utilities for fetching all results across pages
4. Add comprehensive tests with mock responses
5. Add logging capabilities

The implementation follows the SDK's architecture guidelines and provides a solid foundation for the Astral API integration.
