## **10. Orchestration & Project Setup Guide**  
  *Description*: Setting up the development environment and orchestrating contributions following best practices.

   - *Sub-tasks*: 
     - [ ] **Development Environment Preparation:**  
       - [ ] Ensure Node.js (>= 18.x recommended for native fetch and ESM support)  
       - [ ] Clone the repository and run `pnpm install` to install dependencies  
       - [ ] Configure npm scripts for common tasks:
         - [ ] `pnpm run build` – compiles TypeScript to `dist/` (both ESM and CJS)
         - [ ] `pnpm run lint` – runs ESLint (and Prettier check)
         - [ ] `pnpm run test` – runs Jest test suite
         - [ ] `pnpm run test:coverage` – runs tests with coverage
         - [ ] `pnpm run format` – runs Prettier to format code
         - [ ] `pnpm run docs` – generates documentation via TypeDoc
         - [ ] `pnpm run demo` to run example usage

     - [ ] **Running and Debugging:**  
       - [ ] Configure `pnpm run build:watch` for continuous compilation during development
       - [ ] Set up `jest --watch` to run tests on change
       - [ ] Configure VSCode settings and launch.json for IDE debugging

     - [ ] **Contribution Workflow:**  
       - [ ] Set up Husky pre-commit hook to run lint and tests
       - [ ] Create guidelines for descriptive commit messages
       - [ ] Configure GitHub CI for pull requests
       - [ ] Create test coverage requirements

     - [ ] **Dependency Management:**  
       - [ ] Pin specific versions of dependencies for stability
       - [ ] Set up dependabot for minor/patch updates
       - [ ] Document update process for major dependencies

     - [ ] **Building & Publishing the SDK:**  
       - [ ] Configure build process to generate:
         - [ ] ES Module build (dist/index.esm.js)
         - [ ] CommonJS build (dist/index.cjs.js)
         - [ ] Type definitions (dist/index.d.ts)
         - [ ] Optional UMD build (dist/browser/umd.js)
       - [ ] Set up package.json exports field for proper resolution
       - [ ] Document publishing process for maintainers

     - [ ] **Maintenance Plan:**  
       - [ ] Create plan for monitoring Astral Protocol updates
       - [ ] Set up monitoring for EAS updates
       - [ ] Configure GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests
       - [ ] Create guidelines for community contributions
       - [ ] Set up dependency vulnerability monitoring
       - [ ] Plan for CI maintenance

   - [ ] *Output*: A fully configured development environment and contribution workflow that ensures code quality and maintainability.

   - *Technical considerations*: 
     - [ ] Use pnpm for all package management operations
     - [ ] Configure Jest for thorough test coverage
     - [ ] Set up VSCode configuration for consistent developer experience
     - [ ] Follow semantic versioning for releases
     - [ ] Ensure proper package exports configuration
     - [ ] Create comprehensive maintenance documentation
