## **5.2 Comprehensive Testing and Quality Assurance**
*Description*: Implement comprehensive automated and manual testing for all SDK functionality, with special focus on onchain workflows and real blockchain interaction testing. This phase incorporates improved process management with clear scope validation, real-time progress updates, explicit completion criteria, systematic quality gates, and better communication protocols.

- *Branch Setup*:
  - [x] Create new branch: `phase/5.2-comprehensive-testing`
  - [x] Ensure we're branching from `phase/5.1-onchain-registrar-integration` with latest Phase 5.1 changes

- *Scope Validation and Pre-Work Assessment*:
  - [ ] **SCOPE CHECK**: Validate that all onchain methods from Phase 5.1 are working properly:
    - [ ] `createOnchainLocationProof` - verify implementation exists and compiles
    - [ ] `verifyOnchainLocationProof` - verify implementation exists and compiles  
    - [ ] `revokeOnchainLocationProof` - verify implementation exists and compiles
  - [ ] **BASELINE CHECK**: Run current test suite to establish baseline:
    - [ ] Document which tests are currently passing/failing
    - [ ] Identify specific test failures to address
    - [ ] Verify that Phase 5.1 async initialization fixes are working
  - **Checkpoint**: Document scope validation results before proceeding
