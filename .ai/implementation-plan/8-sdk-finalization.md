## **8. AstralSDK Finalization and Testing**  
  *Description*: Complete the AstralSDK implementation with any remaining methods, comprehensive testing, and examples to ensure the library is production-ready.
   
   - *Sub-tasks*: 
     - [ ] Implement remaining utility methods in AstralSDK:
       - [ ] `getVersion(): string` 
         - [ ] Return the current SDK version
         - [ ] Make sure it matches package.json
       
       - [ ] `disconnect(): void`
         - [ ] Clean up any provider event listeners
         - [ ] Close any open connections
         - [ ] Reset initialized state if appropriate
         - [ ] Add debug logging for cleanup operations

     - [ ] Ensure comprehensive error handling:

         - [ ] Test with various location formats and media types
       
       - [ ] Test complete onchain workflow end-to-end
         - [ ] Create, register, verify, and revoke onchain proofs
         - [ ] Test with various chain configurations
       
       - [ ] Test query operations
         - [ ] Fetch individual proofs by UID
         - [ ] Query collections with various filters
         - [ ] Test pagination handling
       
       - [ ] Test error handling and edge cases
         - [ ] Test with invalid inputs
         - [ ] Test with unavailable resources
         - [ ] Test with network failures
         - [ ] Test with invalid configurations

     - [ ] Create comprehensive example scripts:
       - [ ] Basic usage example for offchain workflow
       - [ ] Basic usage example for onchain workflow
       - [ ] Query example for retrieving proofs
       - [ ] Advanced example with media attachments
       - [ ] Error handling example
       - [ ] Custom extension example

     - [ ] Documentation finalization:
       - [ ] Ensure all public methods have JSDoc comments
       - [ ] Update README with installation and usage instructions
       - [ ] Update API reference documentation
       - [ ] Add troubleshooting section with common issues
       - [ ] Document extension system for custom extensions

     - [ ] Final code quality checks:
       - [ ] Run linting on all source files: `pnpm run lint`
       - [ ] Run TypeScript type checking: `pnpm run typecheck`
       - [ ] Run all tests: `pnpm run test`
       - [ ] Ensure test coverage is adequate
       - [ ] Review code for consistency and clarity

     - [ ] Prepare for release:
       - [ ] Verify package.json configuration
       - [ ] Check export patterns and entry points
       - [ ] Ensure build process produces correct output
       - [ ] Test installation in a separate project
       - [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md with notable changes

   - [ ] *Output*: A complete, well-tested AstralSDK ready for production use with comprehensive documentation and examples.
   
   - *Technical considerations*: 
     - [ ] Ensure all public APIs are stable and follow consistent patterns
     - [ ] Verify that workflows are clearly separated and well-documented
     - [ ] Check that all dependencies are correctly listed in package.json
     - [ ] Consider browser compatibility where relevant
     - [ ] Ensure TypeScript types are accurate and helpful
     - [ ] Verify the extension system is flexible enough for custom extensions
     - [ ] Consider future versioning and backward compatibility
     - [ ] Ensure adequate test coverage for critical paths
     - [ ] Add performance benchmarks for critical operations if relevant

   - [ ] Run linting: `pnpm run lint`
   - [ ] Run typechecking: `pnpm run typecheck`
   - [ ] Run tests: `pnpm run test`
   - [ ] Commit changes with descriptive message
