## **4. EAS Client Integration**  
  *Description*: Develop the EAS integration module with separate components for offchain signing and onchain registration workflows, leveraging the EAS SDK for all core functionality. Each SDK instance will be bound to a single chain.

  *Implementation Approach*:
  - Use thin wrapper pattern around EAS SDK components
  - Leverage EAS SDK's built-in ethers.js integration for all blockchain interactions
  - Map our domain models to EAS schema data formats
  - Ensure clear separation between offchain and onchain workflows
  - Prioritize type safety and helpful error messages
  - Follow the existing extension system pattern for consistency
  - Use semantic commit messages following the pattern: `type(scope): description`
    - Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
    - Example: `feat(eas): implement chain configuration loader`

## Implementation Report:

The EAS client integration is now complete and fully functional. Here's what has been accomplished:

1. **Chain Configuration**: Implemented `chains.ts` to manage chain-specific EAS contract addresses and schema UIDs.

2. **Type-Safe Schema Handling**: Created `SchemaEncoder.ts` as a wrapper around the EAS SDK's schema functionality with additional type safety and convenience methods tailored to our domain models.

3. **Offchain Workflow**: Implemented `OffchainSigner.ts` for creating and verifying EIP-712 signatures for location proofs using the EAS SDK's offchain module.

4. **Onchain Workflow**: Implemented `OnchainRegistrar.ts` for registering location proofs on-chain through the EAS contract.

5. **Schema Extension System**: Added extensible schema support through the extension system, with built-in location schema support and the ability to add custom schemas.

6. **AstralSDK Integration**: Connected the OffchainSigner to the AstralSDK main entry point, allowing users to create and sign proofs through a clean, consistent interface.

7. **Error Handling**: Implemented specialized error classes for EAS operations, providing clear, contextual error messages for common failure scenarios.

8. **Usage Examples**: Updated the example code to demonstrate the complete workflow from SDK initialization to proof verification.

9. **Testing**: Added tests for the core SDK integration with the OffchainSigner component.

Key improvements to the original design:

1. **Extensibility through Schema Extensions**: The schema extension system allows for easy addition of new schema types while maintaining type safety.

2. **Improved Error Context**: The new EASError class provides component-specific error information making debugging easier.

3. **Simplified APIs**: The integration with AstralSDK now provides a streamlined experience for developers while maintaining the separation between offchain and onchain workflows.

This implementation successfully delivers an MVP that can create, sign, and verify valid location attestations with proper EAS integration.
