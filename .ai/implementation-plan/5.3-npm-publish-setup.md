## **Phase 5.3: Licensing Foundation and Publishing Readiness**

*Description*: Implement a clean, durable licensing and publishing foundation for the Astral SDK that supports permissive open use while enabling future commercial licensing. This includes copyright consolidation, Apache-2.0 licensing, contributor license management, and full npm publishing readiness under a scoped organization.

---

### *Branch Setup*:

* [ ] Create new branch: `phase/5.3-licensing-and-publishing`
* [ ] Ensure the latest working version of the SDK is in `main` before branching

---

### *Scope Validation and Pre-Work Assessment*:

* [ ] **SCOPE CHECK**: Define key components of this phase:

  * [ ] SDK copyright ownership and licensing status
  * [ ] Publishing configuration for npm under `@decentralized-geo/astral-sdk`
  * [ ] CI and token security for automated publishing
  * [ ] Contributor license agreement (CLA) readiness

* [ ] **BASELINE CHECK**: Assess current status of key files and automation:

  * [ ] Verify presence of valid `package.json` with accurate fields (`name`, `version`, `exports`, `peerDependencies`)
  * [ ] Confirm `.npmrc` and GitHub Secrets are not leaking tokens or registry info
  * [ ] Check for any third-party code or dependencies with non-permissive licenses (GPL, etc.)

---

### *Legal Foundation: Copyright and Licensing*:

* [ ] Add `LICENSE` file with full Apache-2.0 text
* [ ] Add SPDX header (`// SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0`) to all source files
* [ ] Draft and include a public usage statement in `README.md` (commercial contact instructions)
* [ ] (Optional) Set up CLA Assistant on GitHub for all external contributors
* [ ] Review all existing contributions for ownership (contractor agreements or PR authorship)

---

### *Publishing Pipeline and Token Security*:

* [ ] User: Create and configure **Granular npm token** scoped to `@decentralized-geo/*`
* [ ] User: Store token as `NPM_TOKEN` in GitHub repo secrets
* [ ] Claude: Implement GitHub Action (`release.yml`) using Changesets to automate:
  * [ ] Version bumping
  * [ ] Changelog generation
  * [ ] Publishing to npm on release PR merge
* [ ] Claude: Add `release.yml` to the `.github/workflows` directory
---

### *CI Quality Gates and Pre-Publish Checks*:

* [ ] Implement `ci.yml` GitHub Action:

  * [ ] `pnpm lint`
  * [ ] `pnpm type-check`
  * [ ] `pnpm test`
  * [ ] `pnpm build`
  * [ ] `pnpm audit --audit-level=high`
* [ ] Add `npm pack --dry-run` to preview contents prior to publish

---

### *Completion Criteria*:

* [ ] First public version (`v0.1.0`) successfully published to npm
* [ ] Licensing, usage expectations, and publishing process are fully documented
* [ ] Contributors are legally cleared and CLA mechanism is live
* [ ] CI gate ensures code is safe, buildable, and ready for real-world use
