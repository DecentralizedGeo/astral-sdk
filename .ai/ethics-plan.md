# Astral SDK Ethics Plan

This document outlines a practical ethics roadmap for the Astral SDK, acknowledging current capabilities while planning for enhanced ethical protections in future versions.

## Core Ethical Principles

1. **User Autonomy**: Users should maintain control over their location data
2. **Privacy by Design**: Privacy considerations should be foundational, not afterthoughts
3. **Transparency**: Clear documentation of capabilities, limitations, and potential risks
4. **Inclusivity**: Consider impacts on diverse user groups with different needs and vulnerabilities
5. **Harm Reduction**: Proactively identify and mitigate potential misuse scenarios

## v0 Implementation Focus

### Technical Approach

- **Leverage Existing Offchain Pathway**: Emphasize the offchain workflow as a privacy-preserving option that enables selective disclosure
- **Precision Warnings**: Implement warnings for high-precision coordinates (sub-500m) to encourage appropriate privacy-utility balance
- **Documentation-First Approach**: While advanced privacy features may require future versions, comprehensive documentation can set expectations

### Documentation Enhancements

1. **ETHICS.md**
   - Acknowledge key tensions (verification vs. privacy, accessibility, etc.)
   - Document current privacy capabilities and limitations
   - Outline planned improvements for future versions
   - Provide guidance on ethical implementation for developers

2. **THREAT-MODELS.md**
   - Document potential misuse scenarios (stalking, surveillance, exclusion)
   - Outline current mitigations and remaining vulnerabilities
   - Provide guidance for developers to consider in their applications

3. **VALUES.md**
   - Articulate guiding principles behind the SDK
   - Make explicit the ethical frameworks being applied
   - Create shared language for contributors and users

4. **Enhanced End-User Documentation**
   - Create templates for applications to transparently communicate with their users
   - Provide example disclosures and consent flows

### Community & Governance

1. **Ethics Advisory Group**
   - Identify 3-5 individuals with diverse perspectives to provide periodic feedback
   - Focus on representatives from: privacy advocacy, human rights, security, and affected communities
   - Create lightweight process for soliciting and incorporating feedback

2. **Structured Feedback Channels**
   - Add FEEDBACK.md with specific ethical questions
   - Create labeled issues for ethics-related concerns
   - Develop a clear process for evaluating and addressing ethical feedback

3. **Development Process Integration**
   - Add ethics considerations section to PR templates
   - Create lightweight impact assessment template for significant features
   - Document ethical reasoning behind key design decisions

## Future Version Roadmap

This section outlines more advanced ethical protections for consideration in future versions:

### v1 Targets

- **Configurable Precision Controls**: Allow developers to set precision thresholds appropriate to their use case
- **Enhanced Anonymization Options**: Implement basic coordinate fuzzing/cloaking techniques
- **Privacy Mode Toggle**: Single configuration option to enable maximum privacy protections
- **Expanded Documentation**: More detailed guidance and examples based on v0 feedback

### v2+ Aspirational Goals

- **Zero-Knowledge Proof Integration**: Explore integration of ZK techniques for enhanced privacy
- **Formal Ethics Review Process**: Establish more structured process for evaluating new features
- **Comprehensive Impact Assessment**: Develop more sophisticated assessment methodology
- **Privacy-Preserving Verification Primitives**: Research and implement advanced techniques that enable verification without revealing precise coordinates

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Immediate (During v0 Development)**
   - Create initial versions of ETHICS.md, THREAT-MODELS.md, and VALUES.md
   - Update PR templates to include ethics considerations section
   - Implement basic precision warnings

2. **Short-Term (1-3 Months Post-v0)**
   - Identify and establish ethics advisory group
   - Create structured feedback channels
   - Develop templates for end-user disclosure

3. **Medium-Term (3-6 Months Post-v0)**
   - First round of advisory group consultation
   - Review and refine documentation based on initial feedback
   - Plan v1 privacy enhancements

4. **Long-Term (6+ Months)**
   - Research advanced privacy techniques (including ZK approaches)
   - Develop more formal impact assessment methodology
   - Begin implementation of v1 privacy features

## Conclusion

This ethics plan acknowledges that building a perfect system from the start is not feasible, but we can still make ethical considerations central to the development process. By emphasizing documentation, transparency, and establishing feedback mechanisms in v0, we create the foundation for increasingly sophisticated ethical protections in future versions.

The offchain workflow already provides meaningful privacy capabilities, and we can build on this foundation while being transparent about current limitations. This approach balances the need to deliver tangible technology with the responsibility to address ethical implications thoughtfully.
